# FEWDFinalProject

My final project for the Front-End Web Development course for General Assembly.

This is a dummy-portfolio. We we're told to have fun with it and use any resources we could. It is also my first ever solo-built project.

I found a typewriter text which prints my name on the home page and the photo slider was challenging as I had to learn some new things like the setTimeout() function.

We only had knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We had to show off these skills.

The Services and Contact links do not work as they weren't necessary for this assignment.

This page is also unresponsive.
